# variables are names that refers to a value
# value 13 is assigned to the variable var1
var1 = 13
print(var1)

# operators are special symbols that represent simple mathematical equations
add = 5+2
sub = 5-2
# we use the asterisk(*) for multiplication
mul = 5*2  # prints out 10
div = 10/2  # prints out 5.0
div1 = 5/2  # prints out 2.5
div2 = 5//2  # prints out 2
# Modulus(%) this operator is used to print the remainder of the two operands
mod = 5 % 2
# prints 5 dots
print('.'*5)
